      <h2>💡 Why am I Selling?</h2>
      <p>I’m serving full-time in the army, and unfortunately, I don’t have the time to manage this business anymore. Even now, as I write this, it’s sad for me to let go of such a profitable venture, but I urgently need funds. Despite being in the army, this shop still brings in revenue with almost no investment in time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card slide-in">
      <h2>🚀 Final Offer:</h2>
      <p>Revenue Image: Visit <a href="https://ibb.co/CK85N6d">https://ibb.co/CK85N6d</a>.
      <p>The bots, along with everything included—such as the members, Restorecord, Sellpass, GFX, and my entire audience—plus the website, are versatile assets that can be leveraged for various businesses. This setup is not just limited to its current use; it can support any future business ventures you have in mind.
The time and effort invested in building the website and coding the bots alone are worth more than what will see it for. These tools will provide long-term value and can be extremely useful for whatever business direction you decide to take next.</p>
      <p>Starting offer: **$5k** for a long-running shop with high potential. This business is perfect for someone with the time to expand it further. With a **4-year experience**, this shop is top-tier from the frontend to the backend. A great investment for the future. 💸</p>
      <p>Someone with experience in running an account shop can easily scale this business to $5k monthly within a month using all the resources I’m providing. If I had the time to manage all these services simultaneously, it would easily generate a minimum of $2k per month without much effort.
